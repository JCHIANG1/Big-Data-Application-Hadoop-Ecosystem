#use this command to see whether the staus of file is healthy or not
#it will also tell you the number of block the file is made of and their node location

#datanode(slaves node) vs. namenode(master node)
- The node where blocks are physically stored are known as the data node, data node only knows about the block it is resposible for.
  The name node on the otherhand, keep tracks of all the file information in HDFS, these information includes the list of blocks that make up
  of the file and their storage location.
- note that name node stores all the meta data files and folder in the disk but it stores the block location is the memory because 
  the new file might constantly coming into the cluster for performance reason it hold the information in the memory. 
- Datanodes are in constant communication with the name node for it to keep track of the block location information.
- Namenode often have high memory compared to the datanode, whereas the datanode is high in disk storage because it has to store the actual data

#Rack vs Cluster
-rack is a group of nodes collected in the network
-cluster is a group of racks connected in the network
