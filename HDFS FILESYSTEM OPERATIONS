#copying a file from the local filesystem to HDFS
%hadoop fs -copyFromLocal docs/test.txt \ hdfs://localhost/user/rae/test2.txt

#we could have omitted the scheme and host of the URI and picked up the default, hdfs://localhost, 
#as specified in core-site.xml:
%hadoop fs -copuFromLocal docs/text.txt /user/rae/test2.txt

#We also could have used a relative path and copied the file to our home directory in HDFS, 
#which in this case is /user/rae:
%hadoop fs -copuFromLocal docs/text.txt test2.txt

#To list the files in the root directory of the local filesystem
%hadoop fs -ls file:///
