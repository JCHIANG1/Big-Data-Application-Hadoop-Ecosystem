#List all contents of the current directory in long list format

#The 1st column gives information regarding file permissions 
#The 2nd Column is the number of links to the file. 
#The 3rd and 4th columns are the owner and the group of the file. 
#The 5th column displays the size of the file in bytes. 
#The 6th column is the date and time the file was last modified. 
#The 7th column is the file or directory name.

#List all contents of the current directory in long list and human readable formats. 
#“-h” will put large files in more readable units than bytes.

#If the content of the file is too large, you can show one page of the content by
$ more grail
#The file is saved as “grail” by default when download from web
#Hit the spacebar to go to the next page. 
#Type “b” to go page up, hit “space” key to go page down. Type “q” to quit.

$ less grail
#Less has more options than more (“less is more and more is less”). 
#use the keyboard Arrows and Page Up/Down to scroll. 
#type “h” for help, which will display additional options.

#pipe the output from cat to more
#A pipe redirects the output from one program to another program for further processing, 
#and it is represented with “|”.
#The cat command has the -n option, which prints line numbers,
but we may also want to use more to view the file one page at a time.
$ cat -n grail | more

#Redirect the standard output (stdout) of a command. 
$ cat myfile.txt > redirect.txt
$ ls -lh > redirect2.txt

#append the standard output to a file
$ cat mycopy.txt >> myfile.txt
#mycopy.txt will be appended to myfile.txt
#Note: “cat mycopy.txt > myfile.txt” will overwrite myfile.txt with the contents output by “cat mycopy.txt”. 
#Thus using >> is crucial if you want to preserve the existing file contents.
